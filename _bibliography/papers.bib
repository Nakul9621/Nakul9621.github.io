abstract = {Solving certain combinatorial optimization problems like Max-Cut becomes challenging once the graph size and edge connectivity increase beyond a threshold, with brute-force algorithms which solve such problems exactly on conventional digital computers having the bottleneck of exponential time complexity. Hence currently, such problems are instead solved approximately using algorithms like Goemans–Williamson (GW) algorithm, run on conventional computers with polynomial time complexity. Phase binarized oscillators (PBOs), also often known as oscillator Ising machines, have been proposed as an alternative to solve such problems. In this paper, restricting ourselves to the combinatorial optimization problem Max-Cut solved on three kinds of graphs (Mobius Ladder, random cubic, Erdös Rényi) up to 100 nodes, we empirically show that computation time/time to solution (TTS) for PBOs (captured through Kuramoto model) grows at a much lower rate (logarithmically: (), with respect to graph size N) compared to GW algorithm, for which TTS increases as square of graph size ((N2)). However, Kuramoto model being a physics-agnostic mathematical model, this time complexity/ TTS trend for PBOs is a general trend and is device-physics agnostic. So for more specific results, we choose spintronic oscillators, known for their high operating frequency (in GHz), and model them through Slavin’s model which captures the physics of their coupled magnetization oscillation dynamics. We thereby empirically show that TTS of spintronic oscillators also grows logarithmically with graph size ((), while their accuracy is comparable to that of GW. So spintronic oscillators have improved time complexity over GW algorithm. For large graphs, they are expected to compute Max-Cut values much faster than GW algorithm, as well as other oscillators operating at lower frequencies, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.}

abstract = {In the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where gravity emerges from non-metricity $Q$, we explore the cosmological implications of its non-minimal coupling to matter. Inspired by the recent success of Chaplygin gas models in explaining dark energy, we consider a background fluid composed of baryonic matter, radiation, and a family of Chaplygin gas variants namely Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG), and Variable Chaplygin Gas (VCG). We constrain these models with three recent observational datasets: Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) data. For the QSO dataset, we propose an analytical expression for errors in comoving distance to circumvent the reliance on Monte Carlo simulations. Using kinematic diagnostics such as the deceleration and jerk parameters and Om diagnostic, we assess deviations of the proposed models from ΛCDM. Our joint analysis of the three datasets reveals that the transition redshift from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion of the universe for the GCG, MCG and VCG models is $0.620_{−0.017}^{+0.018}$, $0.537_{−0.017}^{+0.017}$ and $0.470_{−0.012}^{+0.012}$ respectively, indicating a departure from $\Lambda$CDM.},

  abstract = {Variational quantum factoring (VQF), a variational quantum algorithm, has been proposed as an alternative to Shor’s algorithm for factoring numbers and has been experimentally implemented to factor numbers much larger than what Shor’s algorithm has factorized thus far. The focus of this work is comparing the performance of different variations of quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) in terms of implementing VQF. Hence, VQF has been implemented here on the Qiskit quantum simulation framework using standard QAOA, multi-angle QAOA (maQAOA), conditional value at risk (CVaR) QAOA, and CVar maQAOA. Using these methods, VQF has been implemented for factorizing bi-prime numbers 143 and 291311 using 4 and 6 qubits respectively, and for factorizing a tri-prime number, 175, using 3 qubits. For factoring of 143 and 175, maQAOA yields the highest success probability numbers (0.92 and 0.99 respectively), while for factoring 291311, CVar maQAOA with 0.75 of the total measurements contributing to the expectation value yields the highest success probability.}
