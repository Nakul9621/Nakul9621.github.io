I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-Delhi) advised by Dr. Debajyoti Bera. Previously, I was employed as a software engineer at Oracle Financial Services Software Ltd. in Bangalore.


# Research Interests

My primary area of research lies at the intersection of quantum computing and learning theory. As a general rule of thumb, I am interested in topics related to theoretical cs, circuit complexity, and optimization algorithms.
