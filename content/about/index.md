I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT-Delhi) advised by [Dr. Debajyoti Bera](https://www.iiitd.edu.in/~dbera/). Previously, I was employed as a software engineer at Oracle Financial Services Software Ltd. in Bangalore.


# Research Interests
---
My primary area of research is **Quantum Ensemble Learning** which lies at the intersection of quantum computing and learning theory. I am also intertested (and open to collaborations) in many topics across the length and breadth of theoretical CS such as shallow circuit complexity, quantum linear equation solvers, optimization algorithms (both classical and quantum), etc.
